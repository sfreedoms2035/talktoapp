# Whisper Implementation Troubleshooting Guide

This guide provides solutions for common issues that may occur when using the new Whisper implementation in the TalkToApp application.

## App Crashes When Starting Whisper

If the app crashes when you tap the microphone button in the WhisperNewTestScreen, try the following solutions:

### 1. Check Permissions

Make sure that the app has the necessary permissions:

- Microphone permission
- Storage permissions
- Foreground service permission

You can check and grant these permissions in your device's Settings app:

1. Go to Settings > Apps > TalkToApp > Permissions
2. Make sure all required permissions are granted

### 2. Check Whisper Model

The Whisper implementation requires a model file to function correctly. If the model file is missing or corrupted, the app may crash.

- Check if the model file exists in the assets folder
- Try reinstalling the app to ensure the model file is properly included

### 3. Check Foreground Service

The Whisper implementation uses a foreground service to keep the microphone active even when the app is in the background. If there's an issue with the foreground service, the app may crash.

- Make sure the AndroidManifest.xml file has the necessary service declaration:

```xml
<service
    android:name="com.pravera.flutter_foreground_task.service.ForegroundService"
    android:foregroundServiceType="microphone"
    android:stopWithTask="true" />
```

- Make sure the app has the FOREGROUND_SERVICE and FOREGROUND_SERVICE_MICROPHONE permissions:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.FOREGROUND_SERVICE" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.FOREGROUND_SERVICE_MICROPHONE" />
```

### 4. Check for Conflicting Audio Usage

If another app is using the microphone, the Whisper implementation may fail to start.

- Close any other apps that might be using the microphone
- Restart your device to ensure no background processes are using the microphone

### 5. Check for Memory Issues

The Whisper model requires a significant amount of memory to run. If your device is low on memory, the app may crash.

- Close other apps to free up memory
- Restart your device to clear memory
- Try using a smaller Whisper model if available

## Whisper Not Detecting Speech

If the Whisper implementation is not detecting speech, try the following solutions:

### 1. Check Microphone

Make sure your device's microphone is working correctly:

- Try recording audio with another app
- Make sure the microphone is not covered or obstructed
- Check if the microphone is muted

### 2. Check Audio Volume

Make sure your device's volume is turned up:

- Speak clearly and loudly
- Move closer to the microphone
- Reduce background noise

### 3. Check Whisper Model

The Whisper model may not be properly loaded:

- Restart the app
- Try reinstalling the app
- Try using a different Whisper model if available

## Whisper Stops Working After a While

If the Whisper implementation stops working after a while, try the following solutions:

### 1. Check Battery Optimization

Battery optimization settings may be stopping the foreground service:

- Go to Settings > Apps > TalkToApp > Battery
- Disable battery optimization for the app

### 2. Check Memory Usage

The Whisper model may be using too much memory:

- Close other apps to free up memory
- Restart your device to clear memory
- Try using a smaller Whisper model if available

### 3. Check for System Interruptions

System interruptions may be stopping the foreground service:

- Check if the device is entering doze mode
- Check if the device is killing background processes
- Try keeping the app in the foreground

## Debugging Steps

If you're still experiencing issues, try the following debugging steps:

### 1. Check Logs

Check the logs for error messages:

- Connect your device to a computer
- Run `adb logcat` to view logs
- Look for error messages related to Whisper, flutter_foreground_task, or flutter_sound

### 2. Try the Test Screen

Use the WhisperNewTestScreen to test the Whisper implementation:

1. On the home screen, tap the "Test New Whisper Implementation" button
2. Check if the service initializes correctly
3. Try starting and stopping the service
4. Check for error messages in the transcription display area

### 3. Try a Clean Install

Try uninstalling and reinstalling the app:

1. Uninstall the app from your device
2. Rebuild and reinstall the app
3. Try using the Whisper implementation again
