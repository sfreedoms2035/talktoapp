# TalkToApp Complete System Testing Guide

This guide provides comprehensive instructions for testing the complete TalkToApp system, including both the Android application and the RunPod service.

## Prerequisites

Before testing, ensure you have:

1. **Android Device**: Physical Android device with camera and microphone
2. **RunPod Service**: Running and accessible at the configured IP
3. **Network Connectivity**: Both devices can access the internet
4. **Required Permissions**: Camera, microphone, and storage permissions granted

## Testing the RunPod Service

### 1. Health Check

First, verify the RunPod service is running and accessible:

```bash
# Test health endpoint
curl http://[RUNPOD_IP]:8000/health

# Expected response:
{
  "status": "ready",
  "model_loaded": true,
  "timestamp": 1234567890.123,
  "hostname": "runpod-container",
  "local_ip": "172.16.112.2",
  "listening_host": "0.0.0.0",
  "port": 8000
}
```

### 2. Status Check

Verify the service status and model loading:

```bash
# Get detailed status
curl http://[RUNPOD_IP]:8000/status

# Expected response when ready:
{
  "status": "ready",
  "model_loaded": true,
  "last_request_time": null,
  "request_count": 0
}
```

### 3. Test Processing

Test the multimodal processing with a sample request:

```bash
# Create a test image (or use an existing one)
# Then test processing:
curl -X POST http://[RUNPOD_IP]:8000/process \
  -F "text=What is in this image?" \
  -F "image=@test_image.jpg"

# Expected response:
{
  "response": "This is a test image showing...",
  "timestamp": 1234567890.456
}
```

## Testing the Android Application

### 1. Build and Install

```bash
# Navigate to android_app directory
cd android_app

# Get dependencies
flutter pub get

# Build APK
flutter build apk

# Install on connected device
flutter install
```

### 2. Manual Testing Steps

#### Test Case 1: Application Startup
1. Launch the TalkToApp on your Android device
2. Verify the app displays:
   - Title: "TalkToApp"
   - Status indicator showing "Ready"
   - Trigger detection section
   - Connection status section

#### Test Case 2: Voice Trigger Detection
1. Say "Hey monitor" clearly
2. Observe:
   - Status changes to "Listening"
   - Trigger display shows "Hey monitor" detected
   - App status changes to "Processing"

#### Test Case 3: Camera Functionality
1. After trigger detection, verify:
   - Camera activates and captures image
   - Image is processed and sent to RunPod service
   - Status shows "Sending to AI Service"

#### Test Case 4: Network Connection
1. Ensure RunPod service is running
2. Verify connection status shows "Connected"
3. Test connection by checking health endpoint

#### Test Case 5: AI Processing and Response
1. After image capture, verify:
   - AI response is received from RunPod service
   - Response is converted to speech
   - Audio response is played through device speakers

#### Test Case 6: Error Handling
1. Stop RunPod service
2. Verify:
   - Connection status shows "Disconnected"
   - App handles connection errors gracefully
   - Error messages are displayed appropriately

## Automated Testing

### Run Flutter Tests

```bash
# Run widget tests
flutter test

# Expected output:
# 00:01 +2: All tests passed!
```

The existing tests verify:
1. App launches and displays home screen correctly
2. AppState updates correctly for all states

### Run Integration Tests

```bash
# Run integration tests (if available)
flutter test integration_test/
```

## Performance Testing

### Response Time Testing
1. Measure time from trigger detection to AI response
2. Expected response times:
   - Trigger detection: < 1 second
   - Image capture: < 1 second
   - Network request: < 3 seconds
   - AI processing: < 5 seconds
   - Text-to-speech: < 2 seconds

### Memory Usage Testing
1. Monitor app memory usage during operation
2. Verify no memory leaks during continuous use

## Network Testing

### Connectivity Scenarios
1. **Normal Connection**: Verify full functionality with stable internet
2. **Intermittent Connection**: Test app behavior with unstable network
3. **No Connection**: Verify graceful error handling when offline
4. **Slow Connection**: Test performance with limited bandwidth

### Security Testing
1. Verify HTTPS/SSL for sensitive data transmission
2. Test authentication mechanisms (if implemented)
3. Validate input sanitization

## User Interface Testing

### Screen Layouts
1. Test on different Android versions
2. Verify responsive design on various screen sizes
3. Test portrait and landscape orientations

### Widget Functionality
1. Status Indicator: Changes color based on app state
2. Trigger Display: Shows detected trigger words
3. Connection Status: Displays connection state

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Issue 1: Voice Trigger Not Detected
**Solutions**:
- Check microphone permissions
- Test in quiet environment
- Verify speech_to_text service is working
- Check Android voice recognition settings

### Issue 2: Camera Not Working
**Solutions**:
- Check camera permissions
- Verify camera hardware functionality
- Test with different camera (front/back)

### Issue 3: Network Connection Failed
**Solutions**:
- Verify RunPod service is running
- Check firewall settings
- Test network connectivity
- Verify IP address and port configuration

### Issue 4: AI Response Delayed
**Solutions**:
- Check RunPod service logs
- Monitor GPU memory usage
- Verify model loading status
- Test with smaller image sizes

## Logging and Monitoring

### Android App Logs
```bash
# View Android logs
adb logcat | grep talktoapp
```

### RunPod Service Logs
```bash
# View RunPod logs (via RunPod dashboard)
tail -f /var/log/runpod/service.log
```

## Performance Benchmarks

### Expected Performance Metrics
- **Startup Time**: < 3 seconds
- **Trigger Detection**: < 1 second
- **Image Capture**: < 1 second
- **Network Request**: < 3 seconds
- **AI Processing**: < 5 seconds
- **Text-to-Speech**: < 2 seconds
- **Total Response Time**: < 12 seconds
