2. Ask "What's in this image?" (unintentionally capturing sensitive data)
3. The app captures an image with sensitive information
4. The AI model identifies and handles sensitive content appropriately

**Expected Response**:
"I've detected what appears to be sensitive personal information in this image. For your privacy and security, I recommend not sharing images containing personal data. If you need assistance with non-sensitive content, please provide a different image."

## Customization Examples

### 14. Language Translation

**Scenario**: User wants to translate text visible in an image

**Process**:
1. Say "Hey monitor" to activate the app
2. Ask "Can you translate the text in this image to Spanish?"
3. The app captures an image and sends it to the RunPod server
4. The AI model extracts text and provides translation

**Expected Response**:
"The text in the image reads 'Welcome' in English, which translates to 'Bienvenido' in Spanish."

### 15. Educational Level Adaptation

**Scenario**: User wants responses tailored to a specific educational level

**Process**:

2. Ask "Explain photosynthesis like I'm 10 years old"
3. The app captures an image of a plant and sends it to the RunPod server
4. The AI model provides an age-appropriate explanation

**Expected Response**:
"Photosynthesis is how plants make their own food! Just like you eat to grow big and strong, plants need food too. But plants are special - they make their own food using sunlight, water from their roots, and carbon dioxide from the air. It's like their own little food factory! The green part of the plant (called chlorophyll) catches the sunlight, which powers the food-making process. That's why plants are green!"
