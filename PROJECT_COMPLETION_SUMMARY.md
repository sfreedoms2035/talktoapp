- Git for version control

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/sfreedoms2035/talktoapp.git
cd talktoapp
```

### 2. Setup Android App
```bash
cd android_app
flutter pub get
flutter run
```

### 3. Setup RunPod Application
```bash
cd runpod_app
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py
```

## 📖 Documentation Available

1. **[Architecture Overview](docs/architecture.md)** - System design and component interactions
2. **[Android Setup Guide](docs/android_setup.md)** - Detailed Android app setup
3. **[RunPod Deployment](docs/runpod_deployment.md)** - Cloud deployment instructions
4. **[API Reference](docs/api_reference.md)** - Complete API documentation
5. **[Troubleshooting](docs/troubleshooting.md)** - Common issues and solutions
6. **[Performance Optimization](docs/performance_optimization.md)** - Performance tuning guide

## 🧪 Testing

Run the complete test suite:

```bash
# Android tests
cd android_app
flutter test

# RunPod tests
cd runpod_app
python -m pytest tests/
```

## 🔄 Workflow

1. **User says "Hey monitor"** → App activates voice recognition
2. **User speaks command** → Speech converted to text via Whisper
3. **Camera captures image** → Rear camera takes photo automatically
4. **Data sent to RunPod** → Text and image sent to cloud processing
5. **AI processes request** → Qwen2.5-VL model analyzes text and image
6. **Response returned** → AI response sent back to Android app
7. **Text-to-speech playback** → Response spoken to user

## 🎯 Performance Metrics

- **Voice activation latency**: < 500ms
- **Image capture time**: < 200ms
- **API response time**: < 2 seconds (depending on model complexity)
- **End-to-end latency**: < 3 seconds total

## 🔐 Security Considerations

- **API authentication** implemented for RunPod communication
- **Secure image transmission** with proper encoding
- **Privacy-focused design** with local speech processing option
- **Error sanitization** to prevent information leakage
